# Tutor Scheduler

This was a small data structures class project in Java. The main class reads in data from a text file about availabilities of students for tutoring. The program uses a stack to validate parentheses and use valid data. It then takes in some user input and determines the most convenient times when tutoring should be held and displays the result to the user.
